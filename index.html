            Learning how to play Rummy Counter online is a breeze. You can play
            Indian Rummy Counter on two player tables or six player tables with
            either a single or two decks of cards. Just sit around the table and
            take turns picking and discarding cards. You can choose to pick
            cards from either a closed or open deck, but remember that discarded
            cards must be placed in the open deck. <br /><span

            When playing Rummy Counter online, your objective is to arrange the
            13 cards you’ve been dealt into sets and sequences. You must make at
            least two sets – one without a Joker (pure sequence) and the other
            can use the Joker. The game starts with a toss determining the
            player who will make the first move. Remember to focus on making a
            pure sequence first, then the second sequence, followed by other
            sequences or sets. Have fun playing Rummy Counter and always
            remember to play responsibly!
